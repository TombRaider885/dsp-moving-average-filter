# dsp-moving-average-filter
A simple DSP project using a moving average filter to smooth noisy signals in Python
# DSP Moving Average Filter (Python)

This project implements a simple digital low-pass filter using a moving average technique to smooth noisy signals. The goal is to demonstrate basic DSP concepts like noise reduction, convolution, and signal visualization using Python.

## 📌 Features

- Generates a clean sine wave
- Adds Gaussian noise to simulate real-world interference
- Applies a moving average filter to reduce noise
- Visualizes clean, noisy, and filtered signals using Matplotlib

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📄 Project Report

You can find the detailed project report [(DSP_Filter_Project_Report_ArjunAjith.pdf)](https://github.com/TombRaider885/dsp-moving-average-filter/blob/main/Low%20Pass%20Filter%20using%20Python%20Project%20Report.pdf).

## 🔍 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo or download the Python file.
2. Run `dsp_filter_project.py` in any Python IDE.
3. Adjust the `window_size` variable to experiment with different filter strengths.
